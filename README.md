 Insurance AI project that uses machine learning to predict claims, detect fraud, and assess risk profiles. The goal is to improve accuracy, automate processes, and enhance efficiency in the insurance domain.


Insurance AI Project
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model & deep learning to predict insurance related outcomes, utilizing a variety of techniques such as classification, regression, and NLP. The project is designed to help in decision making processes for insurance companies by providing predictions based on historical data.

The model is build using a combination of Exploratry data Analysis, data preprocessing techniques, machine learning algorithms, and model evaluation metrics. The final model is deployed with a user friendly interface using Streamlit for easy interaction.

Dataset Used
Source: [Dataset Source like Kaggle, OpenML, creating synthetic Data, etc.]
Description: This dataset contains information about customer details, claim amounts, Policy Type and other insurance related variables.
Preprocessing Details:
Handling missing values using imputation fillna() or dropna().
Categorical feature encoding using LabelEncoder.
Feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Data splitting into training and testing sets train_test_split.
Machine Learning Techniques Applied
The following machine learning techniques applied in this project: Classification:
